# Quantum Bit-Flip Error Correction Demo

This mini-project demonstrates a simple quantum error correction scheme using Qiskit. The project simulates the encoding, random bit-flip error, detection, and correction of a single qubit using the 3-qubit bit-flip code.

## What It Shows

- Creation of a logical qubit in superposition (`|+‚ü©`)
- Encoding using the 3-qubit repetition code
- Random injection of a bit-flip error on one of the qubits
- Syndrome measurement using ancilla qubits
- Classical correction based on measurement
- Decoding and final measurement in the X-basis to verify state recovery

## Notable aspects of this project

- Practical use of **Qiskit**
- Simulation of **quantum systems**
- Understanding of **quantum error correction**
- Clear and tested **circuit design**
- Readiness to work on quantum technologies in space and mission-critical systems

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Qiskit
